            <h2>Hello, I'm Michael! </h2>
            <p>I live in Grand Blanc, Michigan. Which is in the middle of farm land, but only 45 minutes from Ann Arbor, Detroit and Lansing. When I was in high school, I attended an in depth Graphic Design class for two years. Afterwards, I had a Certification of Graphic Design. I then went and  graduated from the College for Creative Studies. After my graduation with a Bachelor of Fine Arts, I fell into a career being a commercial and residential painter. After fifteen years in the trades, I had to make a change. The one career that seemed to make the most sense for me and my family was in web development.</p><p>
I have always had a passion for art and design, but over the years found myself intrigued by problem solving. There’s a humungous sense of accomplishment whenever I figured out a solution.  I feel that software engineering and development is the combination of all of these elements.</p>
<p>In my person life, I enjoy as much time as possible with my family. My wife,two children and I love to go on hikes and vacation in a tent in the middle of the woods. With the right career, we may just live out an RV as we travel the country side.</p>
