        <h2>About Michael</h2>
        <p>When I was in high school, I attended an in depth Graphic Design class
          for two years. Afterwards, I had a Certification of Graphic Design. I
          then went and graduated from the College for Creative Studies in Detroit, Michigan. After
          my graduation with a Bachelor of Fine Arts, life took me into a career being
          a commercial and residential painter. After fifteen years in the
          trades, I had to make a change.</p>
        <p>The one career that seemed to make the most sense for me and my family
          was in web development. I have always had a passion for art and
          design, but over the years I found myself intrigued by problem solving.
          There’s a humungous sense of accomplishment whenever I figured out a
          solution. I feel that software engineering and development is the
          combination of all of these elements.</p>
        <p>In my personal life, I enjoy as much time as possible with my family.
          We love to go on hikes and vacation in a tent in the
          middle of the woods. With the right career, we may just live out our dreams traveling out of an
          RV throughout the country.</p>
